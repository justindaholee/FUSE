### *Keywords*: 
in vitro analysis algorithm, transparent data handling, high-throughput, unbiased, user-friendly, visual phenotyping

### *Overview*:
The Berdnt lab developed a google colaboratory notebook that acts as a standalone platform capable of reading, segmenting, aligning, and reporting fluorescent intensity information from epi-fluorescent timecourse data. The notebook relies on the previously published Cellpose cell segmentation algorithm, in conjunction with the Berndt lab's novel specialized cell alignment algorithm. The platform acts a convenitent, free, and blazingling fast method to analyze timecourse data. 
  
### *Motivations*
- Population analysis-based platform for fluorescence data
- Generates easy-to-use platform 
- Aligns methods used to analyze fluorescent data
- Novel frame-by-frame cell identification algorithm that can be used with cellpose segmentation 
- Open source + Free platform
- Mitigating experimental burden associated with hand-drawn segmentation
- Cloud based storage and handling of data attenuates issues with data management and storage
